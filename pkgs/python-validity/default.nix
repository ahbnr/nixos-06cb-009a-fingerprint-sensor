      # in the original setup.py, the dbus-service executable is not installed in /bin, but as a data file to a non-standard location.
      # Hence, we remove its declaration as a data file and declare it as a script instead, so that it is installed to /bin.
      # This is because the buildPythonPackage wrapper will only wrap the executable correctly if it is in the /bin directory

      # The firmware download script is run as part of the installation process on other distributions.
      # However, it tries to identify the system hardware and download different firmware packages depending on the results.
      #
      # This sort of side-effect related behaviour is probably not ideal to have in the build process of a Nix package.
      # Instead, the user shall call `validity-sensors-firmware` themselves when using python validity for the first time.
      # TODO: We should make it so, that the python-validity service downloads the firmware automatically when not present.
      #
      # Hence, we patch the firmware download script so that it downloads the firmware to a temporary directory, instead of trying
      # to write to /usr/share or the Nix store
